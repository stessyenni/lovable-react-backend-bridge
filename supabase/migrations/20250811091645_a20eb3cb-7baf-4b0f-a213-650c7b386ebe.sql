-- Fix RLS policies to allow demo data creation and proper user connections

-- First, let's allow inserting demo profiles by temporarily relaxing the policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Create a more flexible policy that allows both own profile creation and demo user creation
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert profiles" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = id OR  -- Users can create their own profile
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- Or any authenticated user can create demo profiles
);

-- Fix user_connections policies to allow connection requests between any users
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own connections" ON public.user_connections;

-- Allow authenticated users to create connections (this enables connection requests)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create connections" 
ON public.user_connections 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Make sure users can also view all connections to see pending requests
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own connections" ON public.user_connections;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all connections" 
ON public.user_connections 
FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
